question,answer
Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?, I did hear something about that.
And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms., And the other brother?
The queen has two brothers?, There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
I hear they call him the Imp., I hear he hates that nickname.
Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions., Clever girl.
"We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.", Have you?
M’lord.," Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
"You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."," She has odd cravings, our sister."
"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people."," I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?," My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?"
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.," And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?, All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
"Rough night, Imp?"," If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
I didn’t pick you for a hunter., The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
They have my son., The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.", There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
"(shouting) They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."," Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing., And do what?
"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"," Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
Hand of the King?, So it would seem.
And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?," No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
He knew my name?, What?
"He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"," l believe he used the word ""whore""."
"I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."," My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)"
"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."," Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
What good will my sympathies do them?, None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women., One word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!," Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
You can't..., Do you understand?
"The Prince will remember that, little lord."," I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
Little brother., Beloved siblings.
Is Bran going to die?, Apparently not.
What do you mean?, The Maester says the boy may live.
"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.", Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.," Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black., And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."," Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."," My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them., Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Why do you read so much?, Look at me and tell me what you see.
Is this a trick?," What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
Until your brother killed that King.," Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."," A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
The Night's Watch protects the realm from...," Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.," And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son., Good news or bad?
"What're you looking at, halfman?", I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
What do you care about our faces?," It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same., Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
They hate me because I'm better than they are., It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
A bear's balls., You're joking?
"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.", And how do a bear's balls taste?
"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"," Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory., They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"," You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."," Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
Call me what you like., I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."," But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
I always do.," I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two., So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons., Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.", Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"," Eight... no, nine."
All of them brief?," They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."," Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.", It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?, I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.", Of course.
He'll never walk again.," If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.," Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.", Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
He has no memory of that day., Curious.
Why are you here?, Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
"Kneel, Hodor."," Do you like to ride, Bran?"
The boy has lost the use of his legs.," What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
I'm not a cripple., Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
Will I really be able to ride?,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?," I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.," Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."," Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
He's not my master.," No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
She wasn't feeling well.," She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
My lady's whereabouts...," My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
Must have been a pretty sight.," Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
We were outnumbered 10 to one.," A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
"Careful, Imp."," I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
"I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."," My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
"Truly, my lord, we have nothing.", Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
You can have my room.," There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!, Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Our lord is honored by his trust.," I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)", This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
I did... often and loudly.," Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
And why would I do that?, Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.," Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
Five years ago.," She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
"I am not a murderer, Lannister.", Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
The dagger found, What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Should I gag him?, Why? Am I starting to make sense?
Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.," Well, I'm willing if she is."
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch., I like you.
He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!, Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.," If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
Dwarf man making noise!, How would you like to be rich?
Dwarf man still making noise.," My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold."
No gold!," Well, I don’t have it here."
Noise again!, About the gold -
No gold!," Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
Where?," Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -"
You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)," Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
What message?, Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
You wish to confess your crimes?," Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
"Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."," Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
What do you think you’re doing?, Confessing my crimes.
"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."," Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that."
"You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."," Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial."
"If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life.", I understand the law.
"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.", No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.", Agreed.
You demanded a trial by combat.," Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
"My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you."," I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.," Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait."
The trial will be today., Do I have a volunteer?
Can I make the little man fly now?, Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.," If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
"You don't think I'd do it, do you?"," What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?"
Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.," Come, share our fire."
"When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.", I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
We have no use for a half man's promises.," Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies."
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?, That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
"What is ""this""?", The Vale of Arryn.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded., Sorry to disappoint you.
You wouldn't know him.," May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
"Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.", And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."," Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.", Shagga likes axes.
"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.", The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
They do seem rather ferocious.," Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.", Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.," lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
l took her., Took her? From whom?
"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.", And he didn't have anything to say about it?
He said something.," Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
Who would you like me to be?, What did your mother call you?
Shae. What did your mother call you?, My mother died giving birth to me.
ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?, What sort of accent is that?
Foreign., For-
What do you want from me?," What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
And what do l get?," One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
Who told you this? Women you paid?, And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
"Are you in agony, my lion?", No.
You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.," Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
Drink., Let's play a new game.
There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you., Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Not if you win.," No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
What are you good at?, l happen to be a great judge of character.
This sounds like a boring game.," lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
l don't want to play this game., Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
But my mother hit harder., You killed your first man before you were 12.
"lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.", You've been north of the Wall.
Work.," And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
l don't want to play., lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
Drink., And we've established the rules about lying?
The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.," So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
Drink., Are you sure –
"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."," My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
My turn.," Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
Who were you in love with?, That's not how the game works.
Married?, How did you hear that?
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.," Another night, perhaps."
Not another night. This night., lt's not a pleasant story.
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.," So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
"For three chickens, l should hope so."," lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."," Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
You should have known she was a whore.," Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.," As l said, l was young and stupid."
You're sleeping through the war., What?
They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north., Get my squire!
You don't have a squire.," lf l die, weep for me."
You'll be dead. How will you know?, l'll know.
Stay low., Stay low?
"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."," l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!, To battle!
You're a shit warrior., l'm alive?
You're alive., Did we win?
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't., How did our tribesmen do?
"Yeah, good.", lt's nice to see them getting along.
You're wounded., Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."," Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
He wasn't here., Where was he?
"With his other 18,000 men.", And where are they?
"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."," What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me."
Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!, But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.", Of course you are.
What are you doing here?," (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
What are you doing here? This is the small council.," Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
Our father is Hand of the King.," Yes, but in his absence…"
Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.," If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
I've done nothing., Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
I tried to stop it., Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
Robb Stark is a child., Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
What do you know about warfare?, Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
Joffrey is King., Joffrey is King.
You are here to advise him.," I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
How?, You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
One., One?
"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."," Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
This city stinks Like dead bodies.," A bit corpsey, yes."
I love it., You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
And cum and garlic and rum., You can smell cum from the balcony?
I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck., And so did the country.
This is where I belong.," Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
No one will know.," You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
What about you?, Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.," Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
Would you like something for the pain?, What happened?
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father., Where am I?
Why would I lie about it?, To create strife between my sister and me.
"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.", Pod.
"Yes, my lord?", Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
"No, my lord."," You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak., Then my hill tribesmen.
"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.", Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
My love., It was good of you to come.
I want to see you.," Believe me, you don't."
Have you looked?, (shakes his head)
You are a mess., I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
You think I'm here for money?, That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
"Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave.", Leave?
"Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here.", What would we do in Pentos?
"Eat, drink, fuck, live.", I want to go with you.
"So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me."," I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to (Cersei scoffs) serve as hand in his stead., You brought this on yourself.
I’ve done nothing., Do you understand we’re losing the war?
We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces., It was quite a battle.
To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief., (Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
I can always tell., Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."," Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
Who threatened you?, I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
Ned Stark was a man of honor., And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
"“From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."," You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
"I will, Your Grace."," Safe travels, cousin."
"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.", Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.," Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
How do you kill a dead man?, Apparently you burn him.
"One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys)."," I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
"Apologies, my lord."," Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
(Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.," Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"," You know your wines, my lord."
"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."," Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.,Wars have been started for less.
"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."," Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
Orders are orders., Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
I never said they were the queen's orders.," No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
You know your sister better than I do., You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
I don't listen to filth.," That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine).", I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty., The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.," I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."," Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -, The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.," No, we shan't."
These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat., His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him., I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.," Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
"Ha, the people. You think I care?"," You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it."
"He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."," I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."," (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
"You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.", She was my mother too.
You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-, (shushing her) Keep your voice down.
Why? You think your father can hear me? (yells) He's three hundred miles away!, I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am., But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
Scullion? What is a scullion?, (wincing) Kitchen wench.
A kitchen wench?," Yes, but-"
I'm the weakness?," It's a compliment, my lady."
How is being a weakness a compliment?, Language can be a bit tricky here.
"I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.", Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
"Why, yes, of course, my lord.", These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
"Matrimony, huh? Yes."," I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way.", I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.", Precisely.
Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.," But remember, you must tell no one."
Tell no one what?, I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?," For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?, Who better?
"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"," The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
Harrenhal is cursed.," Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.", You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."," I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
(nods), Good. Oh. And remember-
(angry and tearful) You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?, Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon., Dorne is the safest place for her.
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us., That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
She'll be a hostage., A guest.
"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."," It's done, Cersei."
No., You cannot stop it.
No!," Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"," No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."," Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
Leave me out of your next deception.," Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.," No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."," No, you don't."
"No, please, please."," You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
I am your loyal servant., So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
The eunuch has spies everywhere., Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
"There are no goats, halfman."," Well, make do."
"Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert.", So you poisoned him?
(offended) No. Never.," But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
"Lannister, I always served Lannister.", Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service., Good. One of my better ideas.
"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.", The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"," Why, am I about to hear one?"
"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?", Depends on the sellsword.
Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.," He has a sword, the power of life and death."
"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?", I've decided I don't like riddles.
"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.", Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
I'm punishing her.," For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!, The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.," I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."," Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains., You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."," If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
As I said several times., And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn., She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
I am a knight!," An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
You will withdraw these filthy accusations., Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
It's not my fault!," Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."," Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
I only meant I did as I was bid.," Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.", Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."," No, I think not."
My lord?," You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
But her demands?," Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
You will?," Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
Killed? By whom?, Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
Really? Who'd have thought?," Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
"Whomever did it, I say well done."," It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.," And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?", She'll be safer in Dorne.
"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."," It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations., May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.", It's important that we talk about this.
It's wildfire.," Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
No.,MThat's a lie right there.
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?," Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
I'm telling you the truth., The smart money would be on more likely.
She's making wildfire., But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned., I suppose there's only one way to find out.
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please., When did she tell you this?
"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.", Swear to me on what?
On my life., But I don't care about your life.
"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."," All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.," Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?," He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.", It's hard to argue with his assessment.
Not after what he did to your birthday present., The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.", You have to admire his imagination.
He's talking about you., What? Demon monkey?
People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills., Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
You don't need to convince me., Demon monkey.
"Take care, my lord."," I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
(scoffs), My companion takes issue.
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy., How much do you have?
"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.", My friend remains unconvinced.
This is a shit idea.," I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
Traitors! I'll have all their heads.," Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
You can't insult me.," We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
You can't-," I can, I am."
They attacked me!," They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
Let them have her!," If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
RED KEEP HALLWAY, Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
This way.," Are you hurt, my lady?"
The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.," Well done, Clegane."
How many times can you read one raven scroll?," Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
More than we have.," Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."," ""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"," Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually., He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse., I thought the girls might help him.
Did you?, I was wrong. If we can't control him
Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me., It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light., The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.", Sins?
"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""," You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
I like to keep me hands clean.," Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
I don't want to wear a gold cloak., You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."," Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.," Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
What?, What? What? Why are you staring at me?
(scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?, To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves., For questioning?
No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now., We talked about this.
What do we have?, Pig shit.
Odd little boy., I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
He's only a boy., Younger boys are off fighting his war.
He's not ready.," What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."," It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
Do you think I'm an idiot?," No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die., He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?, Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
Because he doesn't have a cock., Neither do you.
"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.", It's not that little.
(laughs), Why are you smiling?
Because I'm happy., And why are you happy?
Because I have your little whore., I thought you preferred blondes.
"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.", Why do you care who I fuck?
"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.", This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.", Where did you find her?
"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.", You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."," You don't buy them, you only rent them."
"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.", And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
Don't forget me., Never.
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself., There are people who want to hurt me.
I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will., I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
I'm yours., Promise me.
The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.," To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
"If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."," A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
I am trying., You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."," I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
"I wish we could, too.", What do you want? Tell me.
"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."," My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
A most highborn plumber., The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game.", I do. Last thing I expected.
And you play it well.," I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.," The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats.", We should sail there immediately.
"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.", A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."," One game at a time, my friend."
"Are you afraid, my lion?"," If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
I won't let them hurt you., I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
It is now., You can't fuck your way out of everything.
"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.", A wedding.
"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"," ""Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting., I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
Do you trust him?," Oddly enough, I do."
Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.," I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."," Well, I'm not."
"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.", What of it?
"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"," Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.," Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."," No, I don't believe you have."
KING'S LANDING," Remember, wait till the ships-"
The ships are in the bay., They must be far enough in-
"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"," I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
Don't get killed.," Nor you, my friend."
"Oh, are we friends now?", Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
"Enhances it, really."," Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
Shae.," Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
Sansa.," Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
"I will pray for your safe return, my lord.", Will you?
Where's our fleet?, On the way.
The king has asked you a question.," Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."," That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
There they are., Archers to their marks.
Nock arrows!, Hold fast.
What are you doing? We need to attack them., Hold fast.
HARBOR WALL," He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
They're coming. They're coming ashore., Rain fire on them.
There are too many.," Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
"Eat shit, dwarf.", You're on the wrong side of the wall.
"Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep."," If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
What would you have me do?, Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
What are you talking about?," Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates., There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
BEHIND THE WALL," Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
BEHIND THE WALL, Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"," No, I don't think so."
"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.", The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."," Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
You're meeting Father today?, How do you know that?
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?," What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
You're going to make me cry., Why do you care what I want from him?
Because you've slandered me to Father before., Slandered? When?
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.," You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
"I was nine, too."," She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.", It's not slander if it's true.
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?, Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.", Any lies in particular?
"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.", Still makes me more clever than you.
"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.", A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
I've been doing that for a while now., Do you grow bored protecting me?
I grow poor protecting you.," Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
Briefly., I'm sure you filled your pockets.
"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.", I thought we were friends.
We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor., How much?
Double., Double?
I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double., I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
Am I enjoying it?, I was very happy as Hand of the King.
You brought a whore into my bed., It wasn't your bed at the time.
"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.", Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
"What do you want, Tyrion?", Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.," I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
You want Casterly Rock?, It is mine by right.
"(sighs) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.", Why?
What are you doing?, I have a list.
A list of people you mean to kill?," For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
You should learn to ignore them.," My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark., The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
So how should we punish them?, Who? Whom?
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall., Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
I hear that you're a pervert., I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
"(chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.", Lady Sansa!
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me., Why sheep shift?
That's the vulgar word for dung., My lady-
"Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.", No. She is no longer yours to torment.
"Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."," Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros., A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
Mm-hmm.," Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
Mm-hmm.," Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?, I'm all for cheating. This is war.
But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner., So that's why you did it? To save lives?
"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.", The Northerners will never forget.
I believe you still have some work to do on that score., Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.", I will not rape her.
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?, Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires., (smirks)
Does that amuse you?," No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
"Easy for me, is it?", When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world., There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
(chuckles), Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
I won't be marrying Ser Loras., I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child., So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
So she can have some happiness in her life., You have children. How happy would you say you are?
"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.", Even Joffrey?
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.," Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
My lion., We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
But you said I should come to you with any problems., Did anyone see you? No.
No., You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.", Baelish doesn't have friends.
I don't know her name.," Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
How do you know her?, I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
She's a whore.," Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
You fucked her.," Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
And was she good? Did you like her?," Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
That Sansa shouldn't trust him., Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"," Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
You pervert. You want her? This child?, I don't even want to talk about her.
But you are., Only because you're making me.
I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out., This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
"Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."," Hmm, yes."
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.," Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
(chuckles), Master of Coin?
It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.," I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city., Not for bastards.
"Thank you, my dear.", Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.," Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
You should have him knighted., If only the Master of Coin had such power.
If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.," Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.", We don't. I did fuck her once.
I know., But we don't.
I know. But how would the queen get that idea?, Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
Keep a low profile.," If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
"Well, you are richer than I am.", Good point.
"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."," I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading.", You think all reading is dull reading.
It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know., The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.," Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
"Yes, my lord.", Podrick.
"Yes, my lord?"," After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
"No, my lord.", Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
"My lord, I don't even", She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
Let me guess. He's not a magician., No.
He's stealing it?," Worse, he's borrowing it."
What's wrong with that?," We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."," Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.," Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
And what if I don't?," Well, you have to."
But what if I don't?," This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
The lad's practically skipping., You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
He's a squire. You don't pay him.," Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin., Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
I didn't tell them anything., What did you do to them?
Lots of things., And they seemed to like these things?
Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it., Only they weren't paid.
"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?", Is that what you're telling us?
"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.", I hope we might speak. In confidence.
"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.", I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
End your life?," I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
Proof? Will there be a trial?, I need to know.
"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?", I don't know. Do I?
"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."," Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?, It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
Naturally., It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?, I understand that.
Good.," But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
And?," And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."," Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.", And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?", I would.
And traditionally paid for by the royal family., (nods)
"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?", My lady-
"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?", Quite sufficient. Thank you.
You're late., What's she doing here?
Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss., I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.," Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
Your jokes are not appreciated.," It wasn't my best, but-"
"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.", Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells., The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib., And how do we do that?
We find Sansa Stark a different husband., Wonderful.
I can and I do., Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.", She's a child!
"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.", And if I refuse?
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed., I was wed. Or don't you remember?
We can have them both killed., It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family., I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.", Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
What do you want me to say?, I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here., Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."," You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."," Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."," Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
Of course.," Alone, if I may."
"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.", Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
She's a foot taller than you., A tall child.
What's the youngest you've ever had?, Not that young.
How much older?, Older.
"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.", Shae isn't going to like it.
Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?, I should never have told you about that.
"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.", Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.", I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
Chains?, Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
Golden chains., You could buy a ship with these.
Do I need a ship?, What?
Am I going somewhere?, Of course you're not going anywhere.
"So, am I invited to your wedding?", I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.," That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?, I don't have a choice. My father-
Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea., What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
And I'm Shae the funny whore., My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?, I swear to you it will not be like that.
No? What will it be like?," I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
I'm not your lady., You are. You'll always be my lady.
"You look very handsome, my lord."," Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."," No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
"I doubt that very much, my lord.", You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
When I have to.," Well, today you have to."
"Will you pardon me, my lord?", Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
You seem rather drunk., Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.", And?
"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.", What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
More than once.," There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
Time for the bedding ceremony., There will be no bedding ceremony.
"Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.", There will be no bedding ceremony.
"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.", I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
"Is that wise, my lord?"," Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
"Is that wise, Tyrion?", Nothing was ever wiser.
What?, Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
Fourteen.," Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
But your father-," If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?, Please don't.
"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."," This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?", There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?", No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
"Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.", Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
I need a sigil.," And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.," (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
Will he?, And where is Prince Oberyn?
"Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince."," Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?, We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?," You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
"Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.", If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.," Oh, they take all kinds."
Even Dornishmen., The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.," Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
(Chuckles)," Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
I was invited to the royal wedding., I thought we were speaking truth.
"The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...", I wasn't actually present.
I'm asking you a question., I've heard rumors.
(Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword., I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
Tell her she needs to eat.," My lady, you do need to eat."
I don't need to eat., If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
How can you help me?," I don't know, but I can try."
I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died., I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.," What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."," Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
My lion., What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? Come here., How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?, Of course I haven't forgotten.
I want you. Don't you want me?, Things are a bit tense right now.
What things?, My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
What's wrong?, I told you. It's not a good time.
It's never a good time. You have your child bride now., Shae.
Do you love her?, Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
That's not an answer., Of course I don't love her.
You tried to ship me away., Ship you away?
Give me diamonds and make me disappear., What in the world are you talking about?
"If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!", Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
Is that any way to speak about our mother?, What’re you doing?
What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities., Who’s helping you?
Varys., Varys?
"There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."," I suppose this is goodbye, then."
"Farewell, little brother."," Jaime, thank you. For my life."
"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"," All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son.", I loved her.
Who?, Shae.
"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.", I murdered her. With my own hands.
It doesn’t matter., It doesn’t matter?
She was a whore!, Say that word again.
And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…," I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity., I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
You shot me. You’re no son of mine., I am your son. I have always been your son.
Gilded steel., You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
I'm not hungry.," You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
I can't fight anymore., What about your left?
"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?", You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...," Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."," You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.," Oh, to be foreign."
Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears., So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.", Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.," She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
A book?," ""The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
"You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?", Don't call me that.
What should I call you?, I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
Our friendship?, There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
What?," You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
What is this?," I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
She doesn't want you., I need to do right by her.
You don't want her., By our children.
What are you afraid of?, I'm not afraid.
You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?, I need you to leave.
I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run., Shae.
"We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.", You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
How many whores have you been with?, I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
We have a new queen., Better her than you.
All taken care of., You saw her board the ship?
"Aye, she's on it.", You saw the ship sail away?
"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.", How do you know?
"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.", There's someone following you?
Hello., Hello.
"Yes, my lord.", We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
"Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.", Your Grace does me a great honor.
Can we leave now?, Let's find out.
"Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?"," I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
"Mm, good. Needs washing down."," If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
"I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.", A noble effort.
"They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.", You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
"I've heard nothing, my lord.", I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king., Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
"No, my lord. You didn't?"," No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
Your father., Of course.
Mace Tyrell., Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne., Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
"I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."," Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
"My lord, she's gone.", Gone?
No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...," No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
"Yes, my lord?", They'll be following you now.
Who will?," I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
"Any other witnesses, my lord?", Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
He's already been called as a witness for the queen., Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
"I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.", Why not?
They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself., And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
"There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.", Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
"I didn't tell them anything, my lord.", Are you going to accept their offer?
My lord.," Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
"You've been good to me, my lord."," Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
"I already gave them an answer, my lord."," I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
My lord.," Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.", Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.," It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
How do you think? Her son died in her arms., Her son?
Don't. You know what's coming?," My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
"Now that you mention it, she did ask."," So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
Depends. Did you do it?, The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?," Well, you could set me free."
You know I can't., Then there's really nothing else to say.
What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.," Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason., Except I didn't do it.
Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark., Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
Father's orders.," Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?", No.
"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?", Not that I know of.
"How would you say he died, then?", Choked on his pigeon pie.
So you would blame the bakers?, Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
"Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."," Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
Silence., Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased., (shakes his head)
One.," You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
You're going to be found guilty.," Oh, you think so?"
Do you trust me?, (nods)
"I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine.""", Shae. Please don't.
Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?," Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
You admit you poisoned the king?," No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.," Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
Have you nothing to say in your defense?," Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
"(To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.", (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell., I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.," I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"," Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
You fell in love with a whore.," Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
Careful. I'm the last friend you've got., At least I got to tell them what they really are.
"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."," Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.," Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
(laughs), Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
It is tempting.," Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
If he wins., Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
My lord., You have new clothes.
Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs., I sent for you days ago.
I've been a bit busy., Doing what?
My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth., Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl., She's dim-witted.
"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."," When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.", And you understand the rules of inheritance?
Falyse is forty and barren., She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle., (scoffs.)
What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time., You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.", Is it two wives you want or two castles?
"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.", I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?, You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
"Your sister's a Lannister, too."," My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.", Does he frighten you so much?
"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?", Because you're my friend.
"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.", I understand.
I'm sorry it has to be this way., Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
We had some good days together.," Yes, we did."
What will you do?, I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.," Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
Your sister., Oh.
Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself., Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed., She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.", I think I would have remembered that.
"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.", You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.", That would have made things so much easier.
"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""," Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.," If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
Soon.," Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
I've never seen him fight.," Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
Oberyn believes in himself., That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
Beheading.," Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
Cousins.," Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple., Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!, Nothing made him happier.
Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted., On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
"The joke wore thin, though.", For you. You drifted away.
I had other interests.," Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
Why?," I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.," Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"," I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
He was twice your size.," He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
I like to move around., You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight., It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
Size does not matter when you are flat on your back., Thank the gods.
Apologies., I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”.", Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
My lord?, I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea., In a box. Why stop now?
There are faster ways to kill yourself., Not for a coward.
"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.", You never told me why you set me free.
Your brother asked me to., You could have said no.
Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.," Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms., A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come., You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.", I’m not well-suited for work.
"I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion.", Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I never said you were perfect., What is it you want exactly?
Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.," Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
"Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?", I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
"No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.", Good luck finding him.
"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.", Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
(Valyrian) A bit “rusty”., (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.," He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."
We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power., And I intend to help her do it.
You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child., You betrayed her!
Careful now.," And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
The second time thanks to you.," Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
"(gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her."," Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
"Forgive me, but why would we bring you?", Pardon me?
Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?," Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--"
Can you fight?, I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
Are you good on a horse?, Middling.
So mainly you talk?, And drink. I’ve survived so far.
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me., I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."," Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends., If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."," When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
You don't like it?, I want to take a walk.
You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.," She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?, You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
The road to Meereen., And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
I told you. A ruler., We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.", I didn't rule. I was a servant.
"Still, a man of talent.", Managed to kill a lot of people.
"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.", She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
Why?, 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive., I find us repulsive.
"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.", You're right. Let's go for a walk.
No., How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
Volantis is a large city., I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.," Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this., (Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
It's a perfectly good face., I'm losing my mind.
"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."," Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf."
"(Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded...", The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
(Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery..., Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
(Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!, We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
(Valyrian) It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head., It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
Where're you going?, I need to speak to someone with hair.
Hello., You've got no drink.
You've got no money.," Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen., That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
You're just saying that.," You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
Why?, Because you have a skeptical mind.
Come on.," (After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
Of course you can. You're shy., I'm not.
Have another drink.," Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start."
Your captor., Do you have wine?
No., I can't sleep without wine.
Then stay awake., You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
I'm not taking you to your sister., You said you were taking me to the Queen.
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve., (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
What business would you have with the Queen?," Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
We are., What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
No wine.," I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
I am., Have you sailed this route before?
No., You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
I think you'll be plenty., You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
No. But the pirates are., Oh.
And then they weren't.," And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
"""The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.""", I would clap.
Get behind!," Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!"
You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?," (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
I suppose that's why they send them there.," It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?"
"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.", Without luck?
"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?", That's the best idea you've had all day.
I can., You’re not hungry?
Of course I’m hungry.," You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
I am not your travelling companion., We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
Do you ever shut up?, I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
Why?, Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities., I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
What do you know about my father?," I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
How?, I only know what I heard
How?, He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
Do you believe in anything?, I believe in many things.
"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?", No.
"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?", No.
It's hard to be a cynic after that., Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
No it doesn’t.," The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
First we have to conquer the world.," We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
Then she rules., So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
She is the rightful heir.," Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
Shh! It’s a slave ship, Why is it anchored?
It will be a dwarf-sized cock., Guess again.
"We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."," The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.," Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
Why?," We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too."
Yes.," My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
Who are you?," I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?, If only I were otherwise.
If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine, You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?, Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.," When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?, Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
I have a very large army and very large dragons., Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned., I know.
Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?," Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
"Yes, many opportunities.", And did he?
No. Not until forced to do so.," He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
So I should kill him?," A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?, Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
It’s probably my safest option., I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
And what would your father do?, My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
Is that why you killed him?," Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this."
I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.," So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
I’m terrible?, I’ve heard stories.
Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?, To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
Which kind is that?, The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.," Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
Perhaps it won’t come to that., It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
Varys? King Robert’s spy master?, Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me., He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
But you trust him?," Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
The brother who killed my father., That’s the one.
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.," Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
I’m not going to kill you., No? Banish me?
No.," So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences., Advise you on what?
How to get what I want., The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool., I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.," And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
The common people.," Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.", It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
"That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money.", The smaller man it is.
You don’t approve?, There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
"Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?", It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt., My father would have liked you.
"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do."," Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
She cannot., You can!
You walk like a rich person., You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy., It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.
Mhysa means mother in Valyrian., I know what mhysa means.
Who wrote it?, Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
The Sons of the Harpy?," Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men."
"The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away.", Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
"How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?", It’s a problem.
"The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.", And have you started looking for that someone?
No tears.," I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation."
It’s not.," No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling."
"Yes, you really are."," All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it., He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
It’s your counsel I need., It’s yours. Now and always.
I do not make dwarf jokes., You think them.
"We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.", Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.
Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid., Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
"The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers.", What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.," Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious."
"If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?", Dragons do not do well in captivity.
How do you know this?, That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
Many times., And did they ever harm you?
Never., Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.
Do they know that?, They will. It’s time they had their supper.
Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol., That’s good. That’s very good.
Who said this?," Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game."
My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.," There, that’s a start."
Only the girls.," Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games."
We do not drink., Until you do.
The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis., You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.," If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
So we will fight them?, Possibly.
Possibly?, It’s a conversation.
You invite the enemy into our city?," I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.," Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach."
I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive., And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.," Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want."
We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go., Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.," Friends, friends, friends, please."
Slavery is the way of our world., You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
What does that mean?," Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice."
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.," Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer."
We speak the Common Tongue., Excellent.
You met with the slavers today., I did.
Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them., I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?, Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
When does she return?, Soon. You have my word.
We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.," And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace."
You have made peace with the slavers?, We offered terms.
Do not use me for your lies., Those men respect you.
They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal., As do I.
"I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.", I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
You promised the slavers they could keep slavery., For a short time.
Seven years is not a short time for a slave., You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
You are wrong to trust these men., I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore., They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
For now is the best we get in our profession., It’s not enough.
"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start."," It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
The people know who brought them freedom.," Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?, Who said anything about “him”?
Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world., Yes.
She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins., She did indeed.
"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.", Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.", I’d settle for obeyed.
I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come., That sounds most excellent --
"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.", We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"," My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
Would you?, Look around. The city has come back to life.
You made a pact with fanatics., I did and it worked.
"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat.", Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
I know., I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.
You seem happy.," I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
I will be happy when our queen returns., Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
Unsullied never drink., Why not?
Rules., And who made these rules? Your former masters?
I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny., That’s how you know it’s working.
I do not know any jokes., Grey worm?
"The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.", Yes.
"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."," A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
I do., Tell a joke.
I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?, You lied to us.
More jokes., I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
That changes nothing., The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers’ forces- -
No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this., And I have acknowledged that. I’m trying- -
You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.," All right, what should the army do?"
"We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.", And then?
The city is on the rise?, Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
Good. Shall we begin?, Do we have a plan?
You don’t approve?, You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
This is entirely different., You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
"Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."," We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.," It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?"
It was a long time ago.," It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
And he paid for them.," Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?"
I’m not fit to rule., We can agree upon that at least.
Will their ships be enough?," With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants., The Seven Kingdoms.
Reasonable., What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home., We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.", Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.," Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
To keep yourself alive., Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."," Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
"Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.", Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
You know him?, I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
"Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."," I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
"If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day."," If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
"It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.", I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people., But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?, You are.
Unluckily for me., Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
She is., Does she miss me terribly?
I didn't ask --," Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
She's starting to let on., Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.," A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.," Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
Forgive me --," Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?", Forever.
"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.", Almost.
You told me you liked this man., I do.
"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.", I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
The Army of the Dead is on the march., The Army of the Dead?
"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"," No, I don't think you're either of those things."
If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne., If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --, It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
I'm a prisoner on this island.," I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
Except to my ship. They took my ship., I wouldn't say we took your ship.
I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.," Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
You probably don't believe me., I do actually.
You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.," It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?, Good question.
I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.," People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave., It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."," Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
What do you mean?, Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
Dragonglass?," Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.," Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?," Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?," I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
Which wise man said this?, I don't remember.
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?," I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?, You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow., It's too great a risk. You're too important.
A difficult situation. They know we're coming., Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
What is it?, We took Casterly Rock.
You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island., We still have the largest army.
Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach., Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.", If I've underestimated our enemies --
I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep., We've discussed this.
My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?, A smart one.
I already have a queen.," My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.", You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.," Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
Not burn him alive alongside his son.," I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
Jon Snow., Did you read it?
And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in., Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
I thought that was what we are trying to avoid., We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall., Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital., The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
I've got my own business in Flea Bottom., What if someone takes the boat?
Don't talk about our father., Listen to me --
What do you want?, Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself., I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
Where did you get that scar?, Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
This is Gendry., He'll do.
You're not a hero., Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."," It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
Jon Snow's not in love with me.," Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
He's too little for me. I didn't mean, As heroes go he is quite little.
"So if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister. From everything you've told me about her she'd rather murder me than speak with me."," Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone."
And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap., Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.
Are we? Laying any traps?," If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start."
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?," Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It's all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle. Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead."
Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.," He did. But you once spoke to me of breaking the wheel. Aegon built the wheel. If that's the kind of queen you want to be, how are you different from all the other tyrants that came before you?"
So we walk into the lion's den?, My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.
"Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises. Except yours.", And I promised him I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.
And?, And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time. As all our great leaders do
When have I lost my temper?, Burning the Tarlys for instance.
That was not impulsive. That was necessary., Perhaps.
Perhaps., Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son. Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell. We had no time to discuss the possibilities before you ended their possibilities.
One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.," I am taking their side. You need to take your enemy's side if you're going to see things the way they do. And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them. Which I want you to do very much. Because I believe in you and the world you want to build. But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime. How do we ensure your vision endures? After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?"
"You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead, is that it?"," You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor. The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, although many flaws"
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.," Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss. But any one of them could have found your heart and end"
"You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you? Is this one of the items you've discussed with your brother in King's Landing?", I'm trying to serve you by planning for the long term.
Who else can?, No one. They knew the risk when they left. You can't win the throne if you're dead. You can't break the wheel if you're dead.
So what would you have me do?," Nothing. Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do. If you die we're all lost. Everyone, everything"
How many people live here?," A million, give or take."
That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?, There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."," I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."," Supporting the enemy, no less."
Hard to blame you., Cersei will anyway.
Come on! You can suck his magic cock later., (Shakes his head.)
"It is, my lord."," I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne.," You've been thinking about our new queen? Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering your allegiances. Remember my offer – whatever they’re paying you, I’ll pay double.”"
Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.," Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.", It's good to see you again.
I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?, You might.
And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it., And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
Where is she?, She'll be here soon.
Didn't travel with you?, No.
His wasn't even good., He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?", We all know that will never happen.
The word of a would-be usurper., There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
I know!," I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit?"
"I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that’s the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies, and lies won’t help us in this fight.", That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?," Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered., I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
I did this. I should go., She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we’re right back where we started.
"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."," I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."," A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.", I didn't know about that.
"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."," Cersei, I didn't know."
the destruction of this family., I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
You killed our father," After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared-", I have never been more sorry about anything.
"I will not hear it, not from you.", (starts)
I will not hear it!," All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
I will not, I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.," If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.," Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.," Mm, not like this."
"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.", Yes.
Why?, Because I think she will make the world a better place.
You said she'd destroy King's Landing., She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.", You're pregnant.
"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"," Because I have balls, and you don't."
"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.", Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
Apologies for leaving like that.," Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
We both survived., Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?, She did.
And you believed her?, She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
The Karstarks.," One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.", And our queen is grateful.
You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men., I'm not that old.
"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.", What is that?
Like you knew your sister?," He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.", I was a fool.
"Yes, here we are.", Together again.
How do they feel about their new queen?, She's your new queen too.
And she is? Different?, She is.
You're sure about her?, I am.
She didn't seem sure about you., It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
Hmm., Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
What?," She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
Your cock., My cock.
"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.", How will he find you?
We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.," When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
No., You've had a strange journey.
Stranger than most., I'd like to hear about it.
That would be something to see.," I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
Mm., You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister., I was speaking in relative terms.
Do you miss it?, Of course I miss it.
"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-", To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
Half cup., And you?
"Well, what do we have here?"," Ser Davos, join us."
Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch., Would you like a drink?
At least we'll die with honor., I think we might live.
All without a shred of combat ability.," Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
We'd better get some rest.," No, let's stay a bit longer."
Mm-mm., Mmm.
(Sighs.) At least we're already in a crypt.," If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
(Scoffs.), What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
And got your face cut in half., And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.", Maybe we should have stayed married.
You were the best of them., What a terrifying thought.
It wouldn't work between us., Why not?
"(to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.", And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.", I'm sure you had your reasons.
I did. I do., So did you?
"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?", I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?," Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one., You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
I'm not Lord of Winterfell., You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
I don't really want anymore., I envy you.
I surmised it., Drink.
Why does he get to go again?, Because it's my game.
(to Brienne) No., Drink.
"You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!", No!
That's a statement about the present.," At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman."
Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem., The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
"No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital."," I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside."
"We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field."," Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over."
"She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.", I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
What? That's not your concern., I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.
You're a dog.," I am the Imp, and I demand to know."
I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror.," Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing up North?"
"Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.", You're supposed to be south.
You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?, That's a bit rude.
"Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?"," You're a knight, thanks to me."
Shut your mouth., I'm just trying-
"I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you."," See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-"
I did not break your nose., How do you know?
"Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-", May I speak?
Why not? Only death will shut you up., We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
"If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?", Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
Highgarden? Are you mad?, It's better than being dead.
Highgarden. Give me your word., You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.
Why her?, You know she loves your brother.
That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.," You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known."
"Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely.", I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
"Well, I suppose that's up to him."," Sansa, look at me."
What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--, She's your queen too.
You're afraid of her., Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.," No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark."
"Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?"," She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that."
"No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne.", He doesn't want the throne.
"I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero."," He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together."
(with distaste) She's his aunt., That never stopped a Targaryen before.
"No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned.", Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
I worry about her state of mind., We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.
I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny., She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all., And how do you know she wasn't?
Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?, We're discussing treason.
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it., Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
"He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need."," Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree."
"And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.", What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
"She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.", He could temper her worst impulses.
As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms., How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
You've always known my reasons.," At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
Even if you know it's a mistake?, I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisers.
You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.," What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne."
"Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost."," So, what happens to her?"
My lord., Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.
"Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now."," Qyburn, you're a rational man."
"Or so I flatter myself, my lord."," We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage."
Yes., Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
"No, it is not a pleasant sound.", I- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.
"My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.", Your queen.
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject., Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.
Jon Snow., Varys.
He knows the truth about Jon., He does.
"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.", I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
And Varys?, Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
(angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission., It was a mistake.
Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?, She trusts me.
"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."," If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.", They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?, What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.," I beg you, my queen-"
The rearguard should be here by daybreak., She wants to attack now.
We speak the common tongue., Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
We have orders to guard the prisoner., Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
No.," Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""," And you're going back to her, to die with her."
You've underestimated her before., She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?," Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.", You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."," She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds., The city will fall tomorrow.
"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-", I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.", Why?
Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-," There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
I'll try.," I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
Your queen will execute you for this.," If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
You would have., You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
It's not safe. Let me send some men with you., I'm going alone.
You freed your brother. You committed treason., I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
No.," Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
(sighs), So is there life after death?
Not that I've seen., I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
You didn't.," I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.," Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.", Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."," My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
Cersei left her no choice.," The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky., And she burned down a city for it.
"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.", Would you have done it?
What?," You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
I don't know.," (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
What's it matter what I'd do?," It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
(sighs)," When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.," Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
My sisters will be loyal to the throne., Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
She doesn't get to choose., No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you., (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
We don't have a king or queen., You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
(to TYRION) I suppose you want the crown., Me? The Imp?
"Who, then?", I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.," Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
"Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand."," N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
And I don't want to be king.," I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
There's still a Night's Watch?, The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
(sighs)," You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
Was it right? What I did?, What we did.
It doesn't feel right., Ask me again in ten years.
I don't expect we'll ever see each other again., I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that."," Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed."
He-, He what? What does he say about me?
We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.," Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.," As you wish, Your Grace."
"In full, my lord Hand.", Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
Indeed we can.," Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
You Master of Grammar now too?," Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
The strong live and the weak don't., Find the best builders and set them to the task.
I think that's a very presumptuous statement., I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
